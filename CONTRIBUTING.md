# Contributing

Create a pull request against the `devel` branch and add Nils Funk and Sotiris
Papatheodorou as reviewers. Once any potential issues are approved and the pull
request is accepted, it will be rebased on the current `HEAD` of `devel`,
fixing any conflicts and merged. The original pull request branch will be
deleted after merging.

Please also have a look at the [common
issues](./doc/supereight_common_issues.md).
